# LiveBooks GTM copy deck (Phase 7)

Use this for [mencarii.com](https://mencarii.com), support articles, and sales one-pagers. **Do not** claim full zero-knowledge for Pro Online key backup — see [`SECURITY.md`](../SECURITY.md).

**Landing:** copy is implemented in `mencarii_landing/index.html` (hero, `#security`, pricing, FAQ).

## Landing headline options

1. **Local-first accounting with OS keychain–bound encryption**
2. **Your ledger stays on your machine — SQLCipher-encrypted, sync when you choose**
3. **US small-business books that work offline; Pro adds bank feeds and MFA-protected recovery**

Avoid: “We never can access your data,” “zero-knowledge Online backup,” “military-grade” without specifics.

## Subhead / value prop

LiveBooks Desktop stores your company file as a **SQLCipher-encrypted SQLite database** on your computer. Encryption keys are wrapped with your operating system’s secure storage (macOS Keychain, Windows DPAPI). Optional **LiveBooks Online Pro** adds bank feeds, subscription billing, and **MFA-protected Online key recovery** if you lose access to this device after an OS reinstall or signed-app upgrade.

## Support / FAQ snippets

**I got a new computer — how do I open my books?**

1. Install LiveBooks Desktop from [mencarii.com](https://mencarii.com).
2. Sign in to the same LiveBooks Online account.
3. If you enabled **Online backup (Pro)** and MFA, use **Recovery Mode** with your Online email, password, and authenticator code. The app restores your encryption key through the main process — we never show the raw key in the browser UI.

**Why does Recovery Mode say “Security context changed”?**

Your OS ties encryption keys to the app’s code-signing identity. Common triggers: new Mac/PC, first launch of the **signed** app after developing on an **unsigned** build, or a renewed code-signing certificate. This is not a wrong “database password” — LiveBooks does not use a separate database password.

**Is my key safe in Online?**

Pro backup uses **envelope encryption** on our servers (Lockbox). We can decrypt and return your key only after **Pro subscription + MFA step-up** on each retrieval, and we email you on every retrieval. This is **not** zero-knowledge escrow; it is a safety net you opt into.

**What if I’m not on Pro?**

Your data remains on this device only. Export backups regularly. A reminder appears when you create a company without Pro.
