/**
 * Day-1 Phase 1.6 — runtime mirror of `build/signingIdentity.mjs`.
 *
 * The `safeStorage`-backed SQLCipher key store is scoped to the app's
 * bundle id + code-signing identity. A silent change to either at build
 * time would brick every shipped user's keychain slot. We freeze the
 * values in `build/signingIdentity.mjs` (so electron-builder always
 * bakes the same identity) and mirror them here so the packaged main
 * process can fail loudly on boot when the running binary doesn't match
 * the frozen contract.
 *
 * The mirror is enforced by `main/tests/testFrozenSigningIdentity.spec.ts`
 * — if you change one constant without the other, the test fails.
