/**
 * main-process Buffer helpers for SQLCipher hex keys.
 *
 * Goals:
 *   * Minimize the time a database key spends as a JS String. V8 strings
 *     are reference-counted and may persist in heap snapshots indefinitely;
 *     Node Buffers can at least be zero-filled before being released.
 *   * Provide a single +withHexKeyBuffer+ scope so the wipe always runs in
 *     +finally+ even if the consumer throws.
 *
 * IMPORTANT: there is NO way to fully scrub a hex key from V8 once IPC
 * +JSON.parse+ touches it. These helpers limit *additional* lifetime,
 * they do not promise a perfect RAM scrub.
